In libft, I created my very own C library with over 50 functions, and the number is growing! This library is really important for my studies at Hive Helsinki, I can re=use it for all my future C Projects.

<ul>
<li>Get_Next_Line and ft_printf are now added to my libft.</li>
<li>I rewrote the Makefile and reorganized the structur of the files.</li>
  </ul>
