The libft project builds on the concepts you learned during Day-06 of the bootcamp
ie code a library of useful functions that you will be allowed to reuse in most of your C
projects this year. This will save you a lot of precious time. The following assignments
will have you write lines of code you already wrote during the bootcamp. See the libft
project as a Bootcamp reminder and use it wisely to assess your level and progress.

Get_Next_Line and ft_printf are now added to my libft.
I reworked the Makefile and reorganized the structur of the files, it was quite messy 
after the first push. 

I'm working currently on the Hive Helsinki project ft_ls. It is a project about recreating
the most used shell command ls. I will add it as soon as it is finnished to my libft, a repo
will be created for catching up with my progress.
